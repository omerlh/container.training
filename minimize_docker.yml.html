# Docker 30,000ft overview

In this lesson, we will learn about:

* Why containers (non-technical elevator pitch)

* Why containers (technical elevator pitch)

* How Docker helps us to build, ship, and run

* The history of containers

We won't actually run Docker or containers in this chapter (yet!).

Don't worry, we will get to that fast enough!

## Elevator pitch

### (for your manager, your boss...)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## OK... Why the buzz around containers?

* The software industry has changed

* Before:
  * monolithic applications
  * long development cycles
  * single environment
  * slowly scaling up

* Now:
  * decoupled services
  * fast, iterative improvements
  * multiple environments
  * quickly scaling out

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Deployment becomes very complex

* Many different stacks:
  * languages
  * frameworks
  * databases

* Many different targets:
  * individual development environments
  * pre-production, QA, staging...
  * production: on prem, cloud, hybrid

## Elevator pitch

### (for your fellow devs and ops)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Escape dependency hell

1. Write installation instructions into an `INSTALL.txt` file

2. Using this file, write an `install.sh` script that works *for you*

3. Turn this file into a `Dockerfile`, test it on your machine

4. If the Dockerfile builds on your machine, it will build *anywhere*

5. Rejoice as you escape dependency hell and "works on my machine"

Never again "worked in dev - ops problem now!"

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## On-board developers and contributors rapidly

1. Write Dockerfiles for your application components

2. Use pre-made images from the Docker Hub (mysql, redis...)

3. Describe your stack with a Compose file

4. On-board somebody with two commands:

```bash
git clone ...
docker-compose up
```

With this, you can create development, integration, QA environments in minutes!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Implement reliable CI easily

1. Build test environment with a Dockerfile or Compose file

2. For each test run, stage up a new container or stack

3. Each run is now in a clean environment

4. No pollution from previous tests

Way faster and cheaper than creating VMs each time!

---

class: extra-details

## Use container images as build artefacts

1. Build your app from Dockerfiles

2. Store the resulting images in a registry

3. Keep them forever (or as long as necessary)

4. Test those images in QA, CI, integration...

5. Run the same images in production

6. Something goes wrong? Rollback to previous image

7. Investigating old regression? Old image has your back!

Images contain all the libraries, dependencies, etc. needed to run the app.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Shipping, before Docker

* Ship packages: deb, rpm, gem, jar, homebrew...

* Dependency hell.

* "Works on my machine."

* Base deployment often done from scratch (debootstrap...) and unreliable.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Shipping, after Docker

* Ship container images with all their dependencies.

* Images are bigger, but they are broken down into layers.

* Only ship layers that have changed.

* Save disk, network, memory usage.

* Dependencies
* Application JAR
* Configuration

## Devs vs Production, before Docker

* Drop a tarball (or a commit hash) with instructions.

* Dev environment very different from production.

* Have to sort out differences and make it work ...

* ... or bounce it back.

* Shipping code causes frictions and delays.

## Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will have:

* Seen Docker in action.

* Started your first containers.

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Hello World

In your Docker environment, just run the following command:

```bash
$ docker run busybox echo hello world
hello world
```

(If your Docker install is brand new, you will also see a few extra lines,
corresponding to the download of the `busybox` image.)

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## That was our first container!

* We used one of the smallest, simplest images available: `busybox`.

* `busybox` is typically used in embedded systems (phones, routers...)

* We ran a single process and echo'ed `hello world`.

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## A more useful container

Let's run a more exciting container:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/#
```

* This is a brand new container.

* It runs a bare-bones, no-frills `ubuntu` system.

* `-it` is shorthand for `-i -t`.

  * `-i` tells Docker to connect us to the container's stdin.

  * `-t` tells Docker that we want a pseudo-terminal.

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Do something in our container

Try to run `figlet` in our container.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# figlet hello
bash: figlet: command not found
```

Alright, we need to install it.

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Install a package in our container

We want `figlet`, so let's install it:

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# apt-get update
...
Fetched 1514 kB in 14s (103 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# apt-get install figlet
Reading package lists... Done
...
```

One minute later, `figlet` is installed!

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Try to run our freshly installed program

The `figlet` program takes a message as parameter.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \ 
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |

## Counting packages in the container

Let's check how many packages are installed there.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# dpkg -l | wc -l
190
```

* `dpkg -l` lists the packages installed in our container

* `wc -l` counts them

How many packages do we have on our host?

---

class: in-person

## Counting packages on the host

Exit the container by logging out of the shell, like you would usually do.

(E.g. with `^D` or `exit`)

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# exit
```

Now, try to:

* run `dpkg -l | wc -l`. How many packages are installed?

* run `figlet`. Does that work?

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

class: self-paced

## Comparing the container and the host

Exit the container by logging out of the shell, with `^D` or `exit`.

Now try to run `figlet`. Does that work?

(It shouldn't; except if, by coincidence, you are running on a machine where figlet was installed before.)

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Host and containers are independent things

* We ran an `ubuntu` container on an Linux/Windows/macOS host.

* They have different, independent packages.

* Installing something on the host doesn't expose it to the container.

* And vice-versa.

* Even if both the host and the container have the same Linux distro!

* We can run *any container* on *any host*.

  (One exception: Windows containers cannot run on Linux machines; at least not yet.)

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Where's our container?

* Our container is now in a *stopped* state.

* It still exists on disk, but all compute resources have been freed up.

* We will see later how to get back to that container.

.debug[[containers/First_Containers.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/First_Containers.md)]
---

## Starting another container

What if we start a new container, and try to run `figlet` again?
 
```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@b13c164401fb:/# figlet
bash: figlet: command not found
```

* We started a *brand new container*.

* The basic Ubuntu image was used, and `figlet` is not here.

* We will see in the next chapters how to bake a custom image with `figlet`.

## Objectives

In this section, we will explain:

* What is an image.

* What is a layer.

* The various image namespaces.

* How to search and download images.

* Image tags and when to use them.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## What is an image?

* Image = files + metadata

* These files form the root filesystem of our container.

* The metadata can indicate a number of things, e.g.:

  * the author of the image
  * the command to execute in the container when starting it
  * environment variables to be set
  * etc.

* Images are made of *layers*, conceptually stacked on top of each other.

* Each layer can add, change, and remove files and/or metadata.

* Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times, and memory use.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Example for a Java webapp

Each of the following items will correspond to one layer:

* CentOS base layer
* Packages and configuration files added by our local IT
* JRE
* Tomcat
* Our application's dependencies
* Our application code and assets
* Our application configuration

## The read-write layer

![layers](images/container-layers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Differences between containers and images

* An image is a read-only filesystem.

* A container is an encapsulated set of processes running in a
  read-write copy of that filesystem.

* To optimize container boot time, *copy-on-write* is used
  instead of regular copy.

* `docker run` starts a container from a given image.

## Multiple containers sharing the same image

![layers](images/sharing-layers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Comparison with object-oriented programming

* Images are conceptually similar to *classes*.

* Layers are conceptually similar to *inheritance*.

* Containers are conceptually similar to *instances*.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Wait a minute...

If an image is read-only, how do we change it?

* We don't.

* We create a new container from that image.

* Then we make changes to that container.

* When we are satisfied with those changes, we transform them into a new layer.

* A new image is created by stacking the new layer on top of the old image.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## A chicken-and-egg problem

* The only way to create an image is by "freezing" a container.

* The only way to create a container is by instantiating an image.

* Help!

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Creating the first images

There is a special empty image called `scratch`.

* It allows to *build from scratch*.

The `docker import` command loads a tarball into Docker.

* The imported tarball becomes a standalone image.
* That new image has a single layer.

Note: you will probably never have to do this yourself.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Creating other images

`docker commit`

* Saves all the changes made to a container into a new layer.
* Creates a new image (effectively a copy of the container).

`docker build` **(used 99% of the time)**

* Performs a repeatable build sequence.
* This is the preferred method!

We will explain both methods in a moment.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Images namespaces

There are three namespaces:

* Official images

    e.g. `ubuntu`, `busybox` ...

* User (and organizations) images

    e.g. `jpetazzo/clock`

* Self-hosted images

    e.g. `registry.example.com:5000/my-private/image`

Let's explain each of them.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Root namespace

The root namespace is for official images. They are put there by Docker Inc.,
but they are generally authored and maintained by third parties.

Those images include:

* Small, "swiss-army-knife" images like busybox.

* Distro images to be used as bases for your builds, like ubuntu, fedora...

* Ready-to-use components and services, like redis, postgresql...

* Over 130 at this point!

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## User namespace

The user namespace holds images for Docker Hub users and organizations.

For example:

```bash
jpetazzo/clock
```

The Docker Hub user is:

```bash
jpetazzo
```

The image name is:

```bash
clock
```

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Self-hosted namespace

This namespace holds images which are not hosted on Docker Hub, but on third
party registries.

They contain the hostname (or IP address), and optionally the port, of the
registry server.

For example:

```bash
localhost:5000/wordpress
```

* `localhost:5000` is the host and port of the registry
* `wordpress` is the name of the image

Other examples:

```bash
quay.io/coreos/etcd
gcr.io/google-containers/hugo
```

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## How do you store and manage images?

Images can be stored:

* On your Docker host.
* In a Docker registry.

You can use the Docker client to download (pull) or upload (push) images.

To be more accurate: you can use the Docker client to tell a Docker Engine
to push and pull images to and from a registry.

## Showing current images

Let's look at what images are on our host now.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
fedora           latest    ddd5c9c1d0f2   3 days ago      204.7 MB
centos           latest    d0e7f81ca65c   3 days ago      196.6 MB
ubuntu           latest    07c86167cdc4   4 days ago      188 MB
redis            latest    4f5f397d4b7c   5 days ago      177.6 MB
postgres         latest    afe2b5e1859b   5 days ago      264.5 MB

## Searching for images

We cannot list *all* images on a remote registry, but
we can search for a specific keyword:

```bash
$ docker search marathon
NAME                     DESCRIPTION                     STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
mesosphere/marathon      A cluster-wide init and co...   105              [OK]
mesoscloud/marathon      Marathon                        31               [OK]
mesosphere/marathon-lb   Script to update haproxy b...   22               [OK]
tobilg/mongodb-marathon  A Docker image to start a ...   4                [OK]
```


* "Stars" indicate the popularity of the image.

* "Official" images are those in the root namespace.

* "Automated" images are built automatically by the Docker Hub.
  <br/>(This means that their build recipe is always available.)

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Downloading images

There are two ways to download images.

* Explicitly, with `docker pull`.

* Implicitly, when executing `docker run` and the image is not found locally.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Pulling an image

```bash
$ docker pull debian:jessie
Pulling repository debian
b164861940b8: Download complete
b164861940b8: Pulling image (jessie) from debian
d1881793a057: Download complete
```

* As seen previously, images are made up of layers.

* Docker has downloaded all the necessary layers.

* In this example, `:jessie` indicates which exact version of Debian
  we would like.

  It is a *version tag*.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Image and tags

* Images can have tags.

* Tags define image versions or variants.

* `docker pull ubuntu` will refer to `ubuntu:latest`.

* The `:latest` tag is generally updated often.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## When to (not) use tags

Don't specify tags:

* When doing rapid testing and prototyping.
* When experimenting.
* When you want the latest version.

Do specify tags:

* When recording a procedure into a script.
* When going to production.
* To ensure that the same version will be used everywhere.
* To ensure repeatability later.

This is similar to what we would do with `pip install`, `npm install`, etc.

.debug[[containers/Initial_Images.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Initial_Images.md)]
---

## Section summary

We've learned how to:

* Understand images and layers.
* Understand Docker image namespacing.
* Search and download images.

## Objectives

At the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Share code between container and host.

* Use a simple local development workflow.

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Local development in a container

We want to solve the following issues:

- "Works on my machine"

- "Not the same version"

- "Missing dependency"

By using Docker containers, we will get a consistent development environment.

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Working on the "namer" application

* We have to work on some application whose code is at:

  https://github.com/jpetazzo/namer.

* What is it? We don't know yet!

* Let's download the code.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/namer
```

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Looking at the code

```bash
$ cd namer
$ ls -1
company_name_generator.rb
config.ru
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
Gemfile
```

--

Aha, a `Gemfile`! This is Ruby. Probably. We know this. Maybe?

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Looking at the `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM ruby

COPY . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN bundler install

CMD ["rackup", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
EXPOSE 9292
```

* This application is using a base `ruby` image.
* The code is copied in `/src`.
* Dependencies are installed with `bundler`.
* The application is started with `rackup`.
* It is listening on port 9292.

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Building and running the "namer" application

* Let's build the application with the `Dockerfile`!

--

```bash
$ docker build -t namer .
```

--

* Then run it. *We need to expose its ports.*

--

```bash
$ docker run -dP namer
```

--

* Check on which port the container is listening.

--

```bash
$ docker ps -l
```

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Connecting to our application

* Point our browser to our Docker node, on the port allocated to the container.

--

* Hit "reload" a few times.

--

* This is an enterprise-class, carrier-grade, ISO-compliant company name generator!

  (With 50% more bullshit than the average competition!)

  (Wait, was that 50% more, or 50% less? *Anyway!*)

---

## Making changes to the code

Option 1:

* Edit the code locally
* Rebuild the image
* Re-run the container

Option 2:

* Enter the container (with `docker exec`)
* Install an editor
* Make changes from within the container

Option 3:

* Use a *volume* to mount local files into the container
* Make changes locally
* Changes are reflected into the container

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Our first volume

We will tell Docker to map the current directory to `/src` in the container.

```bash
$ docker run -d -v $(pwd):/src -P namer
```

* `-d`: the container should run in detached mode (in the background).

* `-v`: the following host directory should be mounted inside the container.

* `-P`: publish all the ports exposed by this image.

* `namer` is the name of the image we will run.

* We don't specify a command to run because it is already set in the Dockerfile.

Note: on Windows, replace `$(pwd)` with `%cd%` (or `${pwd}` if you use PowerShell).

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Mounting volumes inside containers

The `-v` flag mounts a directory from your host into your Docker container.

The flag structure is:

```bash
[host-path]:[container-path]:[rw|ro]
```

* If `[host-path]` or `[container-path]` doesn't exist it is created.

* You can control the write status of the volume with the `ro` and
  `rw` options.

* If you don't specify `rw` or `ro`, it will be `rw` by default.

There will be a full chapter about volumes!

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Testing the development container

* Check the port used by our new container.

```bash
$ docker ps -l
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE  COMMAND  CREATED        STATUS  PORTS                   NAMES
045885b68bc5  namer  rackup   3 seconds ago  Up ...  0.0.0.0:32770->9292/tcp ...
```

* Open the application in your web browser.

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Making a change to our application

Our customer really doesn't like the color of our text. Let's change it.

```bash
$ vi company_name_generator.rb
```

And change

```css
color: royalblue;
```

To:

```css
color: red;
```

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Viewing our changes

* Reload the application in our browser.

--

* The color should have changed.

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Understanding volumes

* Volumes are *not* copying or synchronizing files between the host and the container.

* Volumes are *bind mounts*: a kernel mechanism associating a path to another.

* Bind mounts are *kind of* similar to symbolic links, but at a very different level.

* Changes made on the host or on the container will be visible on the other side.

  (Since under the hood, it's the same file on both anyway.)

## Trash your servers and burn your code

*(This is the title of a
[2013 blog post](http://chadfowler.com/2013/06/23/immutable-deployments.html)
by Chad Fowler, where he explains the concept of immutable infrastructure.)*

--

* Let's mess up majorly with our container.

  (Remove files or whatever.)

* Now, how can we fix this?

--

* Our old container (with the blue version of the code) is still running.

* See on which port it is exposed:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

* Point our browser to it to confirm that it still works fine.

.debug[[containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md](https://github.com/omerlh/container.training.git/tree/master/slides/containers/Local_Development_Workflow.md)]
---

## Immutable infrastructure in a nutshell

* Instead of *updating* a server, we deploy a new one.

* This might be challenging with classical servers, but it's trivial with containers.

* In fact, with Docker, the most logical workflow is to build a new image and run it.

* If something goes wrong with the new image, we can always restart the old one.

* We can even keep both versions running side by side.

If this pattern sounds interesting, you might want to read about *blue/green deployment*
and *canary deployments*.

## Recap of the development workflow

1. Write a Dockerfile to build an image containing our development environment.
   <br/>
   (Rails, Django, ... and all the dependencies for our app)

2. Start a container from that image.
   <br/>
   Use the `-v` flag to mount our source code inside the container.

3. Edit the source code outside the containers, using regular tools.
   <br/>
   (vim, emacs, textmate...)

4. Test the application.
   <br/>
   (Some frameworks pick up changes automatically.
   <br/>Others require you to Ctrl-C + restart after each modification.)

5. Iterate and repeat steps 3 and 4 until satisfied.

6. When done, commit+push source code changes.

## Debugging inside the container

Docker has a command called `docker exec`.

It allows users to run a new process in a container which is already running.

If sometimes you find yourself wishing you could SSH into a container: you can use `docker exec` instead.

You can get a shell prompt inside an existing container this way, or run an arbitrary process for automation.

## `docker exec` example

```bash
$ # You can run ruby commands in the area the app is running and more!
$ docker exec -it <yourContainerId> bash
root@5ca27cf74c2e:/opt/namer# irb
irb(main):001:0> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].map {|x| x ** 2}.compact
=> [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
irb(main):002:0> exit
```

## Stopping the container

Now that we're done let's stop our container.

```bash
$ docker stop <yourContainerID>
```

And remove it.

```bash
$ docker rm <yourContainerID>
```

## Section summary

We've learned how to:

* Share code between container and host.

* Set our working directory.

* Use a simple local development workflow.
